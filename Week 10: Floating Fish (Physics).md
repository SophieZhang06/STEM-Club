Materials:

●	Dry erase markers

●	Clear containers

●	Spoons

Lesson plan:

●	Introduce experiment (5 minutes)

●	Discuss science and demonstrate (10 minutes)

●	Students do experiment (20 minutes)

○	Draw something (eg. fish, flower) on the back side of the spoon with the dry erase marker

○	Wait a bit for it to dry

○	Slowly enter it into the water so that it floats off

●	Clean up (10 minutes)


Science:

●	Density and what floats

●	Solubility and why it doesn’t dissolve after drying

●	Dry-erase ink composition: It contains an oily silicone polymer that doesn't adhere to non-porous surfaces like metal or ceramic. This allows water to slip underneath the drawing, gradually lifting it off. 

●	Floating action: Since the ink is lighter than water, the design detaches and floats freely—creating a captivating visual effect.
