Materials:

●	Hot water

●	Baking soda

●	Vinegar

●	Sugar

●	Lemonade

●	Cups

Lesson plan:

●	Introduce experiment (5 minutes)

●	Discuss science and instructions (10 minutes)

●	Students do competition (20 minutes)

  ●	Prepare five separate cups of household liquids: one with water, one with baking soda solution, one with vinegar, one with sugar solution, and one with lemonade

  ●	Make indicator: soak chopped cabbage in hot water, strain the purple liquid

  ●	Add indicator to cups: test each household liquid with a few drops

  ●	At this point, you will notice that the originally colorless liquids now each have a new color, and every color is different

●	Clean up (10 minutes)

Science:

●	Purple cabbage (also called red cabbage) contains anthocyanins, natural pigments that change color depending on the pH (acidity/alkalinity) of the liquid they are in
Color Changes by Acidity

  •	Strongly acidic (pH ~2, e.g., lemon juice, vinegar): Bright red

  •	Weakly acidic (pH 4–6, e.g., soda, orange juice): Pinkish or purple-red

  •	Neutral (pH ~7, e.g., plain water): Purple

  •	Weakly basic (pH 8–10, e.g., baking soda solution): Blue

  •	Strongly basic (pH >11, e.g., soap solution): Greenish-yellow
