●	Papers

●	Scissors


Lesson plan:

●	Introduce experiment (5 minutes)

●	Discuss science and demonstrate (10 minutes)

●	Students do experiment (20 minutes)

●	Use scissors to cut the paper to the large coin sized circle

●	Rub needle with magnet (magnetizes it)

●	Place needle on paper and float in water
