Materials:

●	Many sheets of paper

●	Many clear plastic cups of water

●	Coloured pencils

Lesson plan:

●	Introduce experiment (5 minutes)

●	Discuss science and demonstrate (10 minutes)

●	Students do experiment (20 minutes)

o	Each student receives a piece of paper and a cup

o	The students spend 10 minutes drawing a small design on their piece of paper. It can be anything as long as it is not symmetrical.

o	The students place the paper behind their cup and pour water into the cup, watching as the image on the paper becomes distorted and flipped.

●	Clean up (10 minutes)

Science:

●	Refraction

○	Light travels at a different speed in different mediums (for example, it travels differently in air compared to water)

○	Water is denser than air, so light travels at a slower speed in water

○	The image is only flipped when it is at a certain distance behind the cup of water
