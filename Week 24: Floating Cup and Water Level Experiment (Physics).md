Also named “Water Displacement and Buoyancy” Experiment

Materials:

●	Two glasses, one can be placed inside the other (a few pairs)

●	Water

Lesson plan:

●	Introduce experiment (5 minutes)

●	Discuss science and demonstrate (10 minutes)

●	Students do experiment (20 minutes)

1.	Prepare the Glasses

o	Take two clear glasses, one large and one small. Fill both the large and the small glass with water until they are about two-thirds full.

2.	Place the Small Glass into the Large Glass

o	Gently lower the small glass into the larger glass so that it floats.

o	Observe the water level in the large glass at this point.

3.	Press the Small Glass Down

o	Carefully press the small glass downward so that some of the water from the large glass seeps into the small one.

o	Allow the small glass to fill partially with water, but make sure it still floats (it does not sink to the bottom).

4.	Observe the Water Level Again

o	Observe water level in the large glass after some water has entered the small glass.

o	Notice that as long as the small glass continues to float, the water level in the large glass does not change.

●	Clean up (10 minutes)

Science:

●	This experiment demonstrates the principle of water displacement and buoyancy (Archimedes’ Principle): a floating object always displaces a volume of water equal to its total weight, so the water level in the large glass stays constant even when water enters the smaller floating cup
