Materials:

●	Borax

●	Cornstarch

●	Glue

●	Warm water (bring a bottle or two)

●	Food colouring (optional)

●	Measuring spoons

●	Mixing tool

●	Containers for mixing (four)

●	Marker

●	Ziploc bag

Lesson plan:

●	Introduce experiment (5 minutes)

●	Discuss science and demonstrate (10 minutes)

●	Students do experiment (20 minutes)

Steps:

o	One container is for borax, one container is for ball mixture 

o	2 tbsp warm water + ½ teaspoon borax powder + food colouring into the borax container

o	1 tbsp glue into the ball mixture container

o	Then add ½ tsp borax solution and 1 tbsp cornstarch into the ball mixture container

o	Wait 10–15 seconds before stirring, then use hands to knead when it becomes difficult to stir

o	After ball solidifies, bounce it

o	Put it in a Ziplog bag when done

Execution:

o	Each of two instructors has two containers (four containers in total)

o	First demonstrate how to make one ball

o	Split the students in half, so that each person is in charge of half of the students, and we do it at the same time after demonstrating

o	They come up to the instructors and take turns making their ball

●	Clean up (10 minutes)

Science:

●	Chemical reaction

Polymers (plastic is a polymer) → acts like rubber when bounced
When it bounces, the polymer chains uncoil and straighten again → stretchy and bouncy
