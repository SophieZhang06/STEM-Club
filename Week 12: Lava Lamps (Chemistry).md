Materials:

●	Rubber bands

●	Tissue paper

●	Cups

Lesson plan:

●	Introduce experiment (5 minutes)

●	Discuss science and demonstrate (10 minutes)

●	Students do experiment (20 minutes)

o	Students do activity in groups of 3-4

■	Each group gets two cups and one pair of chopsticks, with paper placed underneath

o	Pour oil into cup 1, until it reaches the first line

o	Pour vinegar into cup 1, until it reaches the second line

o	Add 4 drops of food colouring into cup 1 (blue or red, or mix)

o	Mix cup 1

o	Pour baking soda into cup 2, until it reaches the first line

o	Pour water into cup 2, until it reaches the second line

o	Mix cup 2

o	Bit by bit, pour the contents of cup 2 into cup 1

●	Clean up (10 minutes)

Science behind the effect:

●	Density

○	Oil is less dense than vinegar, so it floats on top

○	Vinegar is water-based (it is water + acetic acid)

○	What happens if you put water and oil together? Do they mix?

■	Water and oil are immiscible – they do not mix because the attraction between molecules within water and within oil are far stronger than the attraction between molecules of water and molecules of oil

●	Chemical reaction

○	Baking soda and water mix to become sodium hydroxide and carbonic acid

■	NaHCO3 + H2O = NaOH + H2CO3

■	Carbonic acid causes the fizz in sodas

○	Reaction between baking soda and vinegar (the sodium of baking soda and the acid of vinegar)

■	Creates carbon dioxide bubbles, Why do they rise to the surface? (density)

●	Rise to the surface as it is less dense

■	Globs of coloured water stick to these bubbles

■	At the surface, these bubbles pop, and the coloured water sinks back down
