Materials:

●	Paper cups

●	2-5 meters cotton stings

●	Scissors

●	Paper clips to secure the string inside the cups

●	Tape to reinforce the hole in the cup so it doesn’t tear

Lesson plan:

●	Introduce experiment (5 minutes)

●	Discuss science and instructions (10 minutes)

●	Students do competition (20 minutes)

○	Prepare the Cups - Use the scissors to poke a small hole in the center of the bottom of each cup. Make sure the hole is just big enough for the string to pass through.

○	Attach the String - Thread one end of the string through the hole in the bottom of the first cup. Tie it securely to a paper clip, bead, or toothpick so it doesn’t pull back through the hole. Repeat the same with the other end of the string and the second cup. (Optional) Use tape to reinforce the area around the hole to prevent tearing.

○	Set Up the Telephone - Have two students (or partners) hold one cup each. Walk far enough apart so the string is pulled tight and straight between the two cups. Make sure the string does not touch any objects, as this will interrupt the vibrations.

○	Test the Sound - One student speaks into their cup while the other listens at the other end. Switch roles to test both ways. Try whispering or speaking louder to observe differences.

○	Explore Further - Change the string length (shorter vs. longer). Test different strings (cotton, yarn, fishing line, or thread). Try different cups (paper, plastic, or Styrofoam). Record observations about which combinations make the sound clearer.

●	Clean up (10 minutes)

Science:

●	Sound is produced by vibrations in the air. When you speak into one cup, your voice makes the cup’s bottom vibrate. The string carries these vibrations as mechanical waves. The vibrations reach the second cup, making it vibrate and reproducing the sound for the listener.

●	Purple cabbage (also called red cabbage) contains anthocyanins, natural pigments that change color depending on the pH (acidity/alkalinity) of the liquid they are in
