Materials:

●	Cornstarch

●	Food colouring

●	Water

●	Cups (one per student)

●	Trays (one per student or group of students)

Lesson plan:

●	Introduce experiment (5 minutes)

●	Discuss science and demonstrate (10 minutes)

●	Students do experiment (20 minutes)

 ○	Add cornstarch into the cup
 
 ○	In a separate shared cup, add water and food colouring (use multiple cups for multiple colours)
 
 ○	Pour coloured water into each student’s cup that has cornstarch in it
 
 ○	Students play with the oobleck with their hands or pour it into the tray
 
●	Clean up (10 minutes)

Science:

●	Chemical reactions: a change in the molecular or ionic structure of a substance, unlike a physical reaction such as a change in state

●	Viscosity: the thickness of a fluid, how easily it moves, and how resistant it is to flow (examples include water, which has low viscosity, and honey, which has high viscosity)

●	The science behind oobleck: solid when a force is applied, liquid otherwise; its viscosity changes depending on the force that is applied
