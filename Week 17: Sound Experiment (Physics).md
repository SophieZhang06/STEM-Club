Materials:

●	Rubber bands

●	Tissue paper

●	Cups

Lesson plan:

●	Introduce experiment (5 minutes)

●	Discuss science and demonstrate (10 minutes)

●	Students do experiment (20 minutes)

o	Every student gets a cup or every group gets a tissue box

o	Every student gets three rubber bands

o	First, try to make a sound with the rubber band itself

o	Second, try to make a sound with the rubber bands on the cup

■	Squishing the cup changes the pitch. Why?

o	Third, try to make a sound with the rubber bands on the cup and tissue paper inside the cup

■	It should be quieter

o	Fourth, try to make the two rubber bands produce different sounds by stretching or compressing it

■	Note: make sure the rubber band is securely attached to the cup to ensure safety

●	Clean up (10 minutes)

Science:

●	The vibration of the rubber band causes sound waves, which then enters our ears and produces what we know as sound

○	The vibration causes movement in surrounding air molecules

○	Chain reaction of molecules bumping into each other

●	The cup resonates the sound

●	When the rubber band is stretched out, there’s more tension so it vibrates faster

○	Frequency: number of vibrations per second → more frequency means higher pitch

●	“acoustics”: study of sound, and non-electronic music
