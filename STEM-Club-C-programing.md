1: SALTWATER EGG FLOAT (PHYSICS)

Materials:

 Eggs
 
 Salt
 
 Water Cups and spoons


Lesson plan:

 Introduce experiment (5 minutes)
 
 Discuss science and demonstrate (10 minutes)
 
 Students do experiment (20 minutes)
 
 Place an egg in plain water and it sinks
 
 Add spoonful of salt into water and stir
 
 Watch as egg rises and float
 
 Clean up (10 minutes)


Questions to ask students:

 What do you think happens next?
 
 Why does the balloon inflate?



Science:

 Salt water is denser than fresh water.
 The egg floats when the liquid density is greater than the egg's density
