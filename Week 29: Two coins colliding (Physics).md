Materials:

●	Two coins

●	Ruler

Lesson plan:

●	Introduce experiment (5 minutes)

●	Discuss science and demonstrate (10 minutes)

●	Students do experiment (20 minutes)

○	Place two coins along the side of the ruler on the table with one coin close to table edge

○	Use finder to quickly move the coin far from the edge to make it hit the other coin

○	Repeat as many times as you want of the above steps

○	Observe if the coins can both drop down to the ground (No, they can not)

●	Clean up (10 minutes)

Science:

●	This experiment has to be done as a head-on collision; eequal mass, exchange of speeds; a hands-on way to see how one moving object can set another into motion and how energy and momentum behave in real life

●	Newton’s Laws of Motion

First Law (Inertia): The coin at the edge of the table stays at rest until acted upon by the moving coin.

Second Law (F = ma): The flick provides a force that accelerates the first coin.

Third Law (Action–Reaction): When the moving coin collides with the stationary coin, each coin exerts an equal and opposite force on the other.

●	Law of Conservation of Linear Momentum

In the collision, momentum is transferred from the moving coin to the stationary coin.

If the coins are of equal mass (e.g., identical coins), the first coin almost stops, and the second coin moves forward with most of the speed.

This explains why the coin near the edge often falls off, while the first coin remains on the table.

●	Conservation of Energy (Elastic Collisions Approximation)

The collision is nearly elastic if the coins are hard and smooth.

That means kinetic energy is mostly conserved, and very little is lost to sound or heat.

The transfer of energy is efficient, so the edge coin gets pushed strongly and can fall off the table.
