Materials:

●	Clear plastic cups

●	Water

●	Oil

●	Food colouring

●	Toothpicks

Lesson plan:

●	Introduce experiment (5 minutes)

●	Discuss science and demonstrate (10 minutes)

●	Students do experiment (20 minutes)

o	Each group receives a cup and one toothpick per student

o	Each group pours water until their cup is ¾ full

o	Each group pours around 2 cm of oil

o	Each group adds 3-4 drops of each colour of food colouring so that it sits in the oil, undissolved

o	The students take turns poking the food colouring drops with their toothpick so that the food colouring “explores” when it enters the water

●	Clean up (10 minutes)

Science:

●	Density

○	Oil is less dense than water, which is why it sits at the top of the water (even though it initially sinks to the bottom due to the force from pouring it in)

●	Solubility

○	Oil is insoluble in water so the oil droplets eventually gather together into a single layer of oil

○	Food colouring is insoluble in oil but soluble in water, so it does not dissolve when it is in the layer of oil but it does dissolve when poked into the water
