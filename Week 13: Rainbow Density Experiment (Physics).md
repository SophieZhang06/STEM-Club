Materials:

●	3-4 colours of food colouring

●	Plastic cups

●	Sugar

●	Spoon

●	Mixing utensils (ex. chopsticks)

●	Paper

Lesson plan:

●	Introduce experiment (5 minutes)

●	Discuss science and demonstrate (10 minutes)

●	Students do experiment (20 minutes)

o	Each student or pair of students receives one cup and a few pieces of paper

o	Fill 3-4 cups of water with a couple drops of food colouring, such that each cup is a different colour

o	Place the cups in the desired order (ex. the order of a rainbow)

o	From left to right, pour 6 spoons of sugar in the first cup, 4 spoons of sugar in the second cup, 2 spoons of sugar in the third cup, 0 spoons of sugar in the fourth cup (if applicable)

o	Mix each cup until the sugar is fully dissolved

o	In each student’s individual cup, first pour some of the first cup of food colouring solution (the one with 6 spoons of sugar)

o	Then place paper on the surface of the water such that most of the surface is covered

o	Now pour the food colouring solution from the second cup (with 4 spoons of sugar), ensuring that the water hits the surface of the paper and does not rush to the bottom of the cup

o	Repeat this process for the next two food colouring solutions, adding more paper if necessary

●	Clean up (10 minutes)

Science:

●	Density

○	Sugar is much denser than water

○	A solution with more sugar is denser and stays at the bottom, while a solution with less sugar is less dense and floats at the top

○	By adding different amounts of sugar to each cup, the solutions have a certain order of density, allowing the water to sit at its appropriate place in the rainbow
