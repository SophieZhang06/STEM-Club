Materials:

●	1 paper cup

●	Scissors (to make a small hole at the bottom of the cup)

●	Clear tape (to cover the hole)

●	Laser pointer

●	A wall (2–3 meters away for projection)

Lesson plan:

●	Introduce experiment (5 minutes)

●	Discuss science and demonstrate (10 minutes)

●	Students do experiment (20 minutes)

1.	Prepare the Cup

o	Drill or poke a small hole at the bottom of the paper cup.

o	Cover the hole with a small piece of clear tape.

2.	Set Up the Experiment

o	Stand about 2 meters away from a wall.

o	Point the laser pointer through the hole in the cup so that the red dot shows clearly on the wall.

3.	Add Your Voice

o	Hold the open mouth of the cup near your mouth.

o	Speak slowly into the cup while keeping the laser aimed at the wall.

4.	Observe

o	Watch how the laser dot changes shape on the wall as your voice changes.

●	Clean up (10 minutes)

Science:

•	This experiment demonstrates the principle of water displacement and buoyancy (Archimedes’ Principle): a floating object always displaces a volume of water equal to its total weight, so the water level in the large glass stays constant even when water enters the smaller floating cup
