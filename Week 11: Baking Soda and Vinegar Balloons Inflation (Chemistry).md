Materials:

●	Baking soda

●	Clear plastic bottles, empty

●	Vinegar

●	Balloons

Lesson plan:

●	Introduce experiment (5 minutes)

●	Discuss science and demonstrate (10 minutes)

●	Students do experiment (20 minutes)

○	Pour a bit of vinegar into the bottom of the bottle

○	Pour a bit of baking soda into the balloon

○	Put the balloon onto the bottle

○	Tip it over so that it reacts and the balloon inflates

●	Clean up (10 minutes)

Questions to ask students:

●	What do you think happens next?

●	Why does the balloon inflate?


Science:

●	Chemical reaction creates carbon dioxide which inflates the balloon

●	Neutralization, acid and base

●	Mixing an acid (vinegar) and a base (baking soda) produces carbon dioxide (CO₂).

●	CO₂ gas builds pressure inside the bottle, pushing into the balloon and causing it to inflate.
