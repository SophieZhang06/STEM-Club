Materials:

●	Egg yolk

●	Baking soda

●	Vinegar

●	Chopsticks (one chopstick per student or group of students)

●	Cups (one per student or group of students)

Lesson plan:

●	Introduce experiment (5 minutes)

●	Discuss science and demonstrate (10 minutes)

●	Students do experiment (20 minutes)

  ○	Add egg yolk and baking soda to the cup and stir with chopstick

  ○	Add vinegar to the cup and watch it “explode”

●	Clean up (10 minutes)

Science:

●	Chemical reactions: a change in the molecular or ionic structure of a substance, unlike a physical reaction such as a change in state

  ○	A chemical reaction is taking place between the baking soda and vinegar

  ○	When a chemical reaction occurs, we observe it through visible changes like bubbling, colour changes, etc.
