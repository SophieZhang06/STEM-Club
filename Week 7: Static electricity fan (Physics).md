Materials:

●	Baking cups (one per student)

●	Pencils or toothpicks (one per student)

●	Paper (one sheet per student)

●	Box of tissue paper

●	Straw (one per student)

Lesson plan:

●	Introduce experiment (5 minutes)

●	Discuss science and demonstrate (10 minutes)

●	Students do experiment (20 minutes)

○	Each student gets a baking cup, pencil/toothpick, sheet of paper, and straw

○	Stick the pencil/toothpick into the upside-down baking cup

○	Fold the sheet of paper such that it can be placed on top of the pencil/toothpick (fold it in half both ways, then along the two diagonals, so that each fold closes the same side of the paper)

○	Rub the straw with a piece of tissue paper, generating static electricity

○	Hold the straw near the paper fan and move it around; the paper should follow the straw

●	Clean up (10 minutes)

Science:

●	Static electricity: electricity that is static, meaning electrons are not moving; there is an imbalance in electrons, so the surface of an object has a buildup of electrons, meaning the overall charge is negative
