Materials:

●	Marshmallows

●	Toothpicks

●	Plates (one per group)

Lesson plan:

●	Introduce experiment (5 minutes)

●	Discuss science and instructions (10 minutes)

●	Students do competition (20 minutes)

○	Each group gets a handful of marshmallows and toothpicks, along with one plate

○	The groups compete to create the highest marshmallow tower

○	After the 20 minutes is up, the group with the highest standing tower wins

●	Clean up (10 minutes)

Science:

●	Structures: a system that is built to support itself and any weights on it

●	Balance: the idea of distributing weights equally so that a structure does not collapse

●	Gravity: the force due to the Earth that attracts any matter towards the Earth

●	Strongest shape: the strongest shape is a triangle because when a force is applied, it is distributed evenly so the triangle does not collapse
