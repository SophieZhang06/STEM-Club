Materials:

●	Two clear cups

●	Hot water

●	Cold water

●	Coloring drop

Lesson plan:

●	Introduce experiment (5 minutes)

●	Discuss science and demonstrate (10 minutes)

●	Students do experiment (20 minutes)

○	Fill one clear cup with hot water, and one clear ciup with cold water

○	Drop a few drops of the coloring into each cup

○	Observe the difference of the color diffusion on each cup

●	Clean up (10 minutes)
