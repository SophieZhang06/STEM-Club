Week 1: Saltwater Egg Float (Physics)
Materials:

  ●	Eggs

  ●	Salt

  ●	Water

  ●	Cups and spoons


Lesson plan:

  ●	Introduce experiment (5 minutes)
  
  ●	Discuss science and demonstrate (10 minutes)
  
  ●	Students do experiment (20 minutes)
  
  ●	Place an egg in plain water and it sinks
  
  ●	Add spoonful of salt into water and stir
  
  ● Watch as egg rises and float
  
  ●	Clean up (10 minutes)
  

Questions to ask students:

●	What do you think happens next?

●	Why does the balloon inflate?

Science:

●	Salt water is denser than fresh water. 

●	The egg floats when the liquid density is greater than the egg's density
