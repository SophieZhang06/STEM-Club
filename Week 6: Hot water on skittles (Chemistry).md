Materials:

●	Skittles

●	Hot water

●	Plates (one per group)

Lesson plan:

●	Introduce experiment (5 minutes)

●	Discuss science and demonstrate (10 minutes)

●	Students do experiment (20 minutes)

○	Each group gets one plate and a handful of skittles

○	Students place skittles around the plate in a circle, in whatever pattern they like

○	Add hot water to the center of the plate and watch the colour come off of the skittles

●	Clean up (10 minutes)

Science:

●	The motion of molecules: hot water speeds up the process of the colour coming off the skittles because heat causes molecules to move faster, thus mixing faster

●	Diffusion: a substance moves from an area of high concentration (the skittles) to an area of lower concentration (the water)
