Materials:

●	A big clear glass bowl

●	Two small metal or glass balls

●	A Ruler


Lesson plan:
●	Introduce experiment (5 minutes)

o	Objective - To observe how sound vibrations can move a surface and make the movement visible by using a laser pointer

●	Discuss science and demonstrate (10 minutes)

●	Students do experiment (20 minutes)

○	Place the ruler horizontally in the bowl and place the ball on top of each side of the ruler

○	Quicly remove the ruler to make the ball dropping down along internal side of the bowl

○	Observe if the two balls arrive to the bottom of the bowl at the same time

○	Observe if the two balls arrive to the bottom of the bowl at the same time

○	You should see the balls arrive to the middle bottom at the same time

●	Clean up (10 minutes)

Science:

●	“Isochrone” comes from Greek, meaning “equal time.”

An isochrone curve is a special path along which objects will reach the bottom in the same time, regardless of where they start from along the curve.

●	Energy conservation: Balls convert gravitational energy into kinetic energy as they roll down.

Equal time property: The bowl approximates the isochrone curve, showing that longer paths are compensated by higher speeds.

Applications: The concept of isochrones appears in physics, engineering, and even in designing pendulums and timekeeping devices (like Huygens’ pendulum clocks).

●	Physics in the Experiment

When you place two balls at different positions on the rim of a large bowl and release them at the same time, both roll down along the curved surface.

Even though one ball may travel a longer path than the other, it also moves faster because it starts from a higher point, converting more gravitational potential energy into speed.

The other ball, starting lower, travels a shorter path, but with less speed.

The two effects balance each other out, so both balls reach the bottom of the bowl at the same time.
