Materials:

●	White school glue (e.g., Elmer's) – 1/2 cup

●	Laundry detergent

●	Mixing cups or bowls (one per student)

●	Single use chopsticks or stir stick (one pair per two students)

●	Ziplock plastic bag (one per student)

●	Shaving foam

●	Food coloring

Lesson plan:

●	Introduce experiment (5 minutes)

●	Discuss science and demonstrate (10 minutes)

●	Students do experiment (20 minutes)

○	Add glue into the mixing cups or bowls

○	Pour in laundry detergent slowly, mixing with chopstick or stir stick until the mixture forms the texture of slime

○	Add food coloring (3-4 drops), either in the given colors or mixing multiple colors to form new ones

○	Add shaving foam for a fluffier texture (optional)

○	Store slime in ziplock plastic bag to take home

●	Clean up (10 minutes)

Science:

●	Slime is made from glue, water, and activators. When you mix them together, they create something stretchy, squishy, and fun!

●	The role of activator in slime: combine with polymer in glue to create a new texture

●	Chemical reactions: a change in the molecular or ionic structure of a substance, unlike a physical reaction such as a change in state

●	Slime is called a non-Newtonian fluid — that means it’s sometimes like a liquid and sometimes like a solid, depending on how you play with it!

Pull slowly? It stretches!

Pull fast? It snaps!
